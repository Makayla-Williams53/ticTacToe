# TicTacToe

## Project for Advanced Java

This was an assignment in my high school class Advanced Java in October of 2022. It was a group project to teach
us the various ways that teams organize their tasks and ideas. I worked alongside Jayden Jimenez(Jayden0519) and Alexa Torres(AlexaGTorres) 
and we had to have a Scrum file in order to keep track of our ideas and progress. The project we made was a fully
functional two player Tic Tac Toe.

1) A grid
2) Cell
3) X/O
